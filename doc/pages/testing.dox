/*! \page Testing Unit Testing Framework 

	LibGimbal provides a built-in unit testing framework, which was architecturally inspired by QTest (which we had originally used for testing), with output
	similar to a combination between QTest and GTest. Since libGimbal runs everywhere, we wanted to ensure that our tests could also run anywhere as well. 
	The testing framework leverages the meta type system and error management back-end to implement a powerful object-oriented testing framework. 

	A unit test program typically comprises a single top-level GblTestScenario object, to which GblTestSuite objects are added. A GblTestSuite represents a 
	sequentially-executing set of test cases. 

	Features
	- Timing
	- Memory utilization
	- Memory leak tracing

	Sample Output from a GblTestSuite:

		* ********* Starting TestSuite [RefTestSuite] *********
		* [ INIT      ]: RefTestSuite
		* [ RUN       ]: RefTestSuite::allocEmpty
		* [      PASS ]: RefTestSuite::allocEmpty (0.011 ms)
		* [ RUN       ]: RefTestSuite::alloc
		* [      PASS ]: RefTestSuite::alloc (0.016 ms)
		* [ RUN       ]: RefTestSuite::allocWithContext
		* [      PASS ]: RefTestSuite::allocWithContext (0.012 ms)
		* [ RUN       ]: RefTestSuite::acquire
		* [      PASS ]: RefTestSuite::acquire (0.010 ms)
		* [ RUN       ]: RefTestSuite::release
		* [      PASS ]: RefTestSuite::release (0.007 ms)
		* [ RUN       ]: RefTestSuite::destructFail
		* [      PASS ]: RefTestSuite::destructFail (0.016 ms)
		* [ RUN       ]: RefTestSuite::destruct
		* [      PASS ]: RefTestSuite::destruct (0.018 ms)
		* [ FINAL     ]: RefTestSuite
		* Totals: 7 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0.090ms, 0/2 leaked (0/544 bytes)
		* ********* Finished TestSuite [RefTestSuite] *********

	Sample Output from a GblTestScenario:

		* [GblTestScenario] Ending Scenario: [libGimbalTests]
		        * Test Suite Totals
		                * Total               :                   24
		                * Passed              :                   24
		                * Skipped             :                    0
		                * Failed              :                    0
		        * Test Case Totals
		                * Total               :                  429
